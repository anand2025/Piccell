      <h2 class="typewriter">Welcome to the photography club</h2>
      <p>We are the Piccell Club, the photography and videography club at IIIT
        Ranchi. Our aim is to capture the beauty of life through our lenses and
        create a community of like-minded individuals who share the passion for
        visual storytelling. We welcome everyone who loves photography and
        videography to join us and explore the world of creativity.
        At the PicCell Club, we are passionate about capturing life's moments
        and bringing them to the world through the lens of our cameras. Our club
        is made up of a community of photographers and videographers who are
        dedicated to honing their craft and exploring the endless possibilities
        of visual storytelling. Whether we are taking candid shots of our fellow
        students on campus, capturing the natural beauty of our surroundings, or
        documenting the excitement of an event, we strive to capture the essence
        of each moment in a way that is authentic and captivating. Our club is
        not just about taking photos and videos, though. It's about building a
        community of like-minded individuals who share a love for creativity and
        self-expression. We believe that the best way to improve our skills is
        by collaborating, sharing ideas, and supporting one another. So if you
        are someone who loves photography and videography, or if you simply want
        to learn more about this art form, we welcome you to join us at the
        PicCell Club. Let's capture the beauty of the world together.
